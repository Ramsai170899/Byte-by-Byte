# **Unit 4: Computer Networking and Communication**

## **Introduction to Networking**

### **What is a Computer Network?**
A **computer network** is a system of interconnected computing devices that share resources and communicate with each other. These devices, called **nodes**, include computers, servers, routers, switches, and other networking hardware. The communication happens through wired or wireless connections using predefined protocols such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).

### **Need and Advantages of Networking**
Computer networks are essential for modern communication, collaboration, and data sharing. Here’s why networking is important:

1. **Resource Sharing** – Devices in a network can share resources like printers, scanners, and storage.
2. **Communication** – Networks enable instant communication through email, messaging, and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).
3. **Data Sharing** – Users can share files and databases across the network.
4. **Remote Access** – Employees and users can access network resources from different locations.
5. **Cost Efficiency** – Sharing resources reduces costs compared to setting up individual systems.
6. **Scalability** – Networks can be expanded by adding more devices as needed.
7. **Centralized Management** – In large networks, system administrators can manage resources efficiently from a central location.

## **Types of Networks**

### **1. Local Area Network (LAN)**
A **LAN** is a network confined to a small geographical area, like a home, school, office, or building. It is commonly used to connect computers, printers, and other devices within a limited space.

- **Characteristics**: High-speed, limited to a small area, private ownership.
- **Example**: A school or office network connecting computers and printers.

### **2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
A **MAN** is a network that spans a city or a large campus. It is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

- **Characteristics**: Covers a city or large region, faster than a WAN, often used by businesses and government organizations.
- **Example**: A city's public Wi-Fi network or a university's multiple-campus network.

### **3. Wide Area Network (WAN)**
A **WAN** covers a vast geographical area, such as multiple cities, countries, or even the entire world.

- **Characteristics**: Long-distance communication, slower than LAN/MAN, requires external infrastructure (ISPs, satellites, fiber optics).
- **Example**: The Internet, which connects millions of devices globally.

### **4. Personal Area Network (PAN)**
A **PAN** is a small network used for personal devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and smartwatches.

- **Characteristics**: Short-range, wireless connections (Bluetooth, Infrared, NFC).
- **Example**: A Bluetooth connection between a phone and a wireless headset.

## **Wired vs. Wireless Networks**

### **1. Wired Networks**
Wired networks use physical cables (Ethernet, fiber optics) for data transmission.

- **Advantages**:
  - Faster and more stable connections.
  - Less interference and higher security.
  - Suitable for high-bandwidth applications.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires cables and infrastructure.
  - Less flexible and difficult to set up.

### **2. Wireless Networks**
Wireless networks use radio signals, infrared, or satellite links for data transmission.

- **Advantages**:
  - No physical cables required.
  - Easy to set up and expand.
  - Supports mobility (Wi-Fi, 5G, Bluetooth).

- **Disadvantages**:
  - More prone to interference.
  - Slower compared to wired networks.
  - Security risks such as hacking and unauthorized access.

## **Network Devices and Components**

### **1. Modem**
A **Modem (Modulator-Demodulator)** converts digital signals from a computer into analog signals for transmission over telephone lines and vice versa.

- **Types**: DSL, Cable, Fiber Optic modems.

### **2. Router**
A **Router** connects multiple networks and directs data packets between them. It allows multiple devices to access the Internet using a single connection.

- **Example**: A home router that connects multiple devices to the Internet.

### **3. Switch**
A **Switch** is a network device that connects multiple devices within a LAN and forwards data only to the intended recipient.

- **Example**: Office LAN switch that connects computers, printers, and servers.

### **4. Hub**
A **Hub** is a basic networking device that broadcasts data to all connected devices, regardless of the recipient.

- **Example**: Older office networks used hubs before switches became common.

### **5. Access Points (AP)**
An **Access Point** extends the range of a wireless network by providing Wi-Fi connectivity.

- **Example**: Wi-Fi access points in a mall or airport.

## **Internet and Web Technologies**

### **1. How the Internet Works?**
The **Internet** is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate using TCP/IP protocols.

- **Key Components**:
  - **ISPs (Internet Service Providers)**: Provide Internet access.
  - **Servers**: Store websites and services.
  - **Data Packets**: Information is broken into packets and sent across the network.
  - **Protocols**: TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP manage communication.

- **Process**:
  - A user requests a website by entering a URL.
  - The request is sent to a **DNS server** to find the correct IP address.
  - The server responds with the requested data.
  - The data travels through multiple routers and networks before reaching the user’s device.

### **2. IP Addressing and DNS**
#### **IP Addressing**
An **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)** is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network.

- **Types**:
  - **IPv4**: Uses a 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
  - **IPv6**: Uses a 128-bit address for more unique addresses.

#### **Domain Name System (DNS)**
Since IP addresses are hard to remember, the **DNS (Domain Name System)** converts domain names into IP addresses.

- **Example**:
  - When you type `www.google.com`, the DNS translates it into an IP address like `142.250.183.206`.

### **3. Web Browsers and Search Engines**
#### **Web Browsers**
A **web browser** is software that allows users to access and navigate websites.

- **Examples**: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge.

- **Functions**:
  - Requests web pages from servers.
  - Displays web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
  - Stores cookies and browsing history.

#### **Search Engines**
A **search engine** helps users find information on the web by indexing and ranking web pages.

- **Examples**: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo.

- **How It Works**:
  - A user enters a query.
  - The search engine scans its index of websites.
  - It ranks and displays the most relevant results.
