## **Unit 6: Computer Security and Ethics**

### **Basics of Cybersecurity**
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, interrupting normal business processes, or extorting money from users.

The primary goal of cybersecurity is to ensure **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)**:
1. **Confidentiality** – Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
2. **Integrity** – Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data.
3. **Availability** – Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when needed.

### **What is Cybersecurity?**
Cybersecurity refers to the **technologies, processes, and practices** designed to protect **networks, devices, programs, and data** from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and cyberattacks. 

#### **Key Areas of Cybersecurity**
- **Network Security** – Protecting a network from intruders, including malware and targeted attacks.
- **Application Security** – Keeping software and devices free from threats.
- **Information Security** – Protecting data from unauthorized access and breaches.
- **Operational Security** – Processes and decisions for handling and protecting data.
- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity** – Plans for responding to cybersecurity incidents.
- **End-user Education** – Training users on best practices to prevent cyber threats.

### **Types of Cyber Threats**
Cyber threats are malicious activities that aim to damage or steal data, disrupt operations, or exploit vulnerabilities. The most common cyber threats include:

#### **1. Malware**
Malware (short for **malicious software**) refers to any software intentionally designed to cause harm to a computer, network, or user. Types of malware include:
- **Viruses** – Attach themselves to legitimate files and spread when executed.
- **Worms** – Self-replicating programs that spread across networks without user intervention.
- **Trojans** – Appear to be legitimate software but secretly perform malicious activities.
- **Ransomware** – Encrypts user data and demands payment for decryption.
- **Spyware** – Secretly collects user information and transmits it to a third party.
- **Adware** – Displays unwanted advertisements and may contain spyware.

#### **2. Phishing**
Phishing is a form of cyber attack where attackers use **deceptive emails, messages, or websites** to trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Types of phishing attacks include:
- **Email Phishing** – Fraudulent emails pretending to be from legitimate sources.
- **Spear Phishing** – Targeted phishing attack on specific individuals or organizations.
- **Vishing** – Voice phishing using fraudulent phone calls.
- **Smishing** – SMS phishing through malicious text messages.

#### **3. Hacking**
Hacking refers to the unauthorized access or manipulation of computer systems and networks. Types of hackers:
- **Black Hat Hackers** – Criminal hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes.
- **White Hat Hackers** – Ethical hackers who help organizations secure their systems.
- **Grey Hat Hackers** – Hackers who exploit vulnerabilities but may disclose them responsibly.

### **Data Protection and Privacy**
Data protection refers to securing personal and organizational data from unauthorized access and misuse. Privacy, on the other hand, ensures that individuals have control over their personal information.

#### **Importance of Data Protection**
- Prevents identity theft and fraud.
- Safeguards confidential business and personal information.
- Complies with data protection laws such as **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) and **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act).

#### **Methods of Data Protection**
- **Strong Passwords** – Using complex passwords and password managers.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Adding an extra layer of security.
- **Data Encryption** – Encoding data so only authorized users can read it.
- **Backup and Recovery** – Regularly backing up data to prevent data loss.

---

### **Encryption and Decryption**
Encryption is a method of securing data by converting it into an unreadable format using an algorithm. Only authorized users with the correct **decryption key** can revert it to its original form.

#### **Types of Encryption**
- **Symmetric Encryption** – Uses the same key for encryption and decryption. (Example: AES)
- **Asymmetric Encryption** – Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. (Example: RSA)

#### **Why is Encryption Important?**
- Protects sensitive data from cybercriminals.
- Ensures secure communication over the internet.
- Prevents unauthorized access to stored or transmitted data.

---

### **Best Practices for Safe Computing**
To stay safe online, users should adopt best practices, including:

1. **Use Strong Passwords** – At least 12 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Adds an extra security layer.
3. **Keep Software and Systems Updated** – Prevents exploits of security vulnerabilities.
4. **Avoid Suspicious Emails and Links** – Helps prevent phishing and malware attacks.
5. **Use Firewalls and Antivirus Software** – Blocks malicious traffic and detects malware.
6. **Limit Personal Information Sharing** – Protects against identity theft.
7. **Use Secure Networks** – Avoid public Wi-Fi or use a **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) for security.

---

### **Ethical Issues in Computing**
Ethics in computing refers to the moral principles and guidelines that govern the responsible use of technology.

#### **Common Ethical Issues**
- **Hacking and Cybercrime** – Unethical hacking can harm individuals and organizations.
- **Privacy Invasion** – Unauthorized collection and misuse of personal data.
- **Digital Divide** – Unequal access to technology and digital resources.
- **Misinformation and Fake News** – Spreading false information online.

---

### **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)**
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protect the **creations of the mind**, including inventions, literary works, symbols, and designs.

#### **Types of Intellectual Property**
- **Copyright** – Protects original works such as books, music, and software.
- **Patent** – Grants exclusive rights to inventors for new inventions.
- **Trademark** – Protects logos, brand names, and symbols.
- **Trade Secrets** – Confidential business information that gives a competitive edge.

#### **Cyber Ethics and IPR Violations**
- **Software Piracy** – Unauthorized copying or distribution of software.
- **Plagiarism** – Copying someone else’s work without credit.
- **Digital Content Theft** – Unauthorized downloading or sharing of digital content.

---

### **Digital Ethics and Responsible Computing**
Digital ethics deals with how individuals and organizations should behave while using digital technologies.

#### **Principles of Digital Ethics**
1. **Honesty** – Avoiding misinformation, fraud, and manipulation.
2. **Privacy** – Respecting personal data and user consent.
3. **Responsibility** – Using technology ethically and securely.
4. **Respect for Others** – Avoiding cyberbullying and online harassment.
5. **Compliance with Laws** – Following data protection regulations and cybersecurity laws.

#### **Examples of Responsible Computing**
- Organizations implementing **ethical AI** to prevent bias.
- Social media platforms controlling **hate speech and misinformation**.
- Companies securing customer data and respecting privacy policies.
