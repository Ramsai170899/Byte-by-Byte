### **Unit 2: Computer Hardware - The Physical Components**
Understanding the physical components of a computer is crucial to understanding how a computer system operates. The components work together to process, store, and transfer data efficiently. Let’s explore the **Computer System Architecture** in detail.

## **Understanding the Computer System Architecture**
Computer architecture refers to the structure and organization of a computer system. It defines how different components of the computer interact with each other and how instructions are executed.

There are two major types of computer architecture:
1. **Von Neumann Architecture**
2. **Harvard Architecture**

## **Components of a Computer**
A computer consists of five main components:
1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
2. **Memory (Primary and Secondary)**
3. **Input Devices**
4. **Output Devices**
5. **Storage Devices**

Each component has a specific function in the computer system.

## **Von Neumann vs. Harvard Architecture**
Both architectures define how a computer stores and processes data, but they have different designs.

### **Von Neumann Architecture**
- Proposed by **John von Neumann** in 1945.
- A single memory is used to store both instructions and data.
- Uses a **single data bus** for both instruction and data transfer.
- The CPU fetches instructions and data sequentially, leading to a potential bottleneck known as the **Von Neumann bottleneck**.
- Example: Used in most modern computers, including desktops and laptops.

### **Harvard Architecture**
- Uses **separate memory** for instructions and data.
- Has **two separate buses**, one for instruction fetch and another for data transfer, allowing parallel execution.
- This architecture improves processing speed and efficiency.
- Example: Used in **microcontrollers, embedded systems, and signal processors**.

## **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
The **CPU (Processor)** is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions.

### **What is a CPU?**
- It is an electronic circuit that carries out instructions from computer programs.
- It performs calculations, logic operations, and controls data movement.

### **Parts of a CPU**
1. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** – Performs mathematical and logical operations.
2. **Control Unit (CU)** – Directs operations within the CPU, fetching, decoding, and executing instructions.
3. **Registers** – Small, high-speed storage locations that hold instructions and data.
4. **Cache** – High-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.

### **How a CPU Processes Instructions**
The CPU follows the **Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle**:
1. **Fetch** – Retrieves the instruction from memory.
2. **Decode** – Interprets the instruction.
3. **Execute** – Performs the operation.
4. **Repeat** – Moves to the next instruction.

## **Memory and Storage**
Memory and storage are essential for holding data, instructions, and system files.

### **Types of Memory**
Memory is divided into three main categories:

1. **Primary Memory (Volatile and Non-Volatile)**
   - **RAM (Random Access Memory)** – Temporary storage that holds active programs and data.
   - **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** – Permanent memory containing essential system instructions (e.g., BIOS).
   - **Cache Memory** – Fast memory between RAM and the CPU to store frequently used instructions.
   - **Registers** – Ultra-fast memory inside the CPU for immediate data access.

2. **Secondary Storage (Non-Volatile)**
   - **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)** – Magnetic storage used for long-term data storage.
   - **SSD (Solid State Drive)** – Faster storage with no moving parts, improving speed and durability.
   - **Optical Disks (CD, DVD, Blu-ray)** – Used for data storage, software distribution, and backups.

3. **Tertiary Storage (Backup and Archival)**
   - **Cloud Storage** – Internet-based storage provided by services like Google Drive and OneDrive.
   - **Tape Drives** – Used for long-term data archiving in enterprise environments.

### **Memory Hierarchy**
Memory is structured in a hierarchy based on **speed, cost, and capacity**:
1. **Registers (Fastest, Smallest)**
2. **Cache Memory**
3. **RAM (Main Memory)**
4. **SSD / HDD (Secondary Storage)**
5. **Cloud / Tape Drives (Slowest, Largest Capacity)**

## **Input and Output Devices**
These devices help users interact with the computer.

### **Input Devices**
Input devices are used to send data and commands to the computer.
1. **Keyboard** – For typing and entering commands.
2. **Mouse** – Pointing device for graphical interfaces.
3. **Scanner** – Converts physical documents into digital format.
4. **Microphone** – Captures audio input.
5. **Touchscreen** – A display that also functions as an input device.

### **Output Devices**
Output devices display or produce the results of processed data.
1. **Monitor** – Displays text, images, and videos.
2. **Printer** – Produces hard copies of digital content.
3. **Speakers** – Output sound from the computer.
4. **Projectors** – Display images or videos on a large screen.

## **Motherboard and Buses**
The **motherboard** is the main circuit board that connects all hardware components.

### **Structure of a Motherboard**
- It hosts the **CPU, RAM, storage, and expansion cards**.
- Provides **ports and connectors** for peripherals.

### **Expansion Slots, Chipsets, and Interfaces**
- **Expansion Slots** – Allow adding extra hardware (e.g., graphics cards, sound cards).
- **Chipsets** – Manage data flow between CPU, memory, and peripherals.
- **Interfaces** – Include USB, SATA, and PCIe connections.

### **Types of Buses**
Buses are pathways for data transfer within the computer.
1. **Address Bus** – Carries memory addresses.
2. **Data Bus** – Transfers actual data.
3. **Control Bus** – Sends control signals between components.

## **Power Supply and Cooling Systems**
The **Power Supply Unit (PSU)** provides electrical power to all components.

### **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**
- Converts **AC power** (from the wall) into **DC power** (used by computer components).
- Supplies different voltage levels (3.3V, 5V, 12V) to various parts.

### **Voltage, Wattage, and Power Ratings**
- Voltage: Measured in volts (V), determines the power flow.
- Wattage: Measured in watts (W), defines power consumption.
- Power Ratings: Ensures components receive adequate power.

### **Cooling Mechanisms**
Computers generate heat, requiring cooling solutions:
1. **Fans** – Move air to dissipate heat.
2. **Heat Sinks** – Absorb and distribute heat away from the CPU/GPU.
3. **Liquid Cooling** – Uses coolant to transfer heat efficiently.
